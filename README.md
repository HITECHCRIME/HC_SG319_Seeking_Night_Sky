## Lyrics

```
I've been seeking night sky I might die 
Call me up another time, 
ritual it's  tonight 
onto fighting on another day
gotta say such a playa
all i ever said was get it right

fearsome of the blight
masses for the carcer
imma stay onto my promise
they might see me as a martyr
i just think i'm out of time
but i haven't still decided
staying silent is a problem
i've been saved by the tar
saved by the tar
saved by the tar aah
i decided why try
semitones crash loud
none of this shit is fine
none of these damn rules apply
imma take my own pride

```
