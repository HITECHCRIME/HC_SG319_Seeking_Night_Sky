## Lyrics

```
i've been seeking night sky I might die 
call me up another time, ritual it's tonight 
onto fighting on another day, gotta say such a playa
all i ever said was get it right

fearsome of the blight, masses for the carcer
imma stay onto my promise, they might see me as a martyr
i just think i'm out of time but i haven't still decided
staying silent is a problem but i'm saved by the tar           /// i've been saved by the tar
saved by the tar

saved by the tar aah
i decided why try, semitones crash (loud)
none of this shit is fine
none of these damn rules apply
imma take my own pride

die in vain, been playing us far too long
words of wisdom are nothing but arcane
sights beholding in your mind 
we've been doing it alone, away from pesky eyes
time after time destroying default orders
sanguinistic tendencies of the borders

```
