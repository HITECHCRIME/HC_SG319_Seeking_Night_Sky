## Lyrics

```
i've been seeking night sky I might die 
call me up another time, ritual it's tonight 
onto fighting on another day, gotta say such a playa
all i ever said was get it right

fearsome of the blight, masses for the carcer
imma stay onto my promise, they might see me as a martyr
i just think i'm out of time but i haven't still decided
staying silent is a problem but i'm saved by the tar           /// i've been saved by the tar
saved by the tar

saved by the tar aah
i decided why try, semitones crash (loud)
none of this shit is fine
none of these damn rules apply
imma take my own pride

```
